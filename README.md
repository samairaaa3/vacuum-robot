# Vacuum Robot AI

An intelligent vacuum robot simulation built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project implements various AI search algorithms to help the robot clean a grid-based environment efficiently.

---

##  Features

- Real-time GUI using Tkinter
- Grid-based environment with:
  - Dirty tiles
  - Walls (obstacles)
- Multiple search algorithms
- Visual animation of agent movement
- Dynamic tile toggling

---

##  Search Algorithms Implemented

-  Breadth-First Search (BFS)
-  Depth-First Search (DFS)
-  Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
-  Greedy Search
-  A* Search
-  Reflex Agent (non-search-based)
